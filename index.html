            The materialisation of new foreign loans to fill nearly $2.5 billion in external
            financing gap for this fiscal year will be a primary focus during next week's
             unscheduled performance review discussions by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p>

    <p>Pakistan faces delays in obtaining loans from bilateral creditors,
        complicating efforts to bridge its external financing gap.
          The Washington-based global lender previously estimated a total $5 billion
           external financing gap for the 2024-2027 period, of which $2.5 billion is
            estimated for this fiscal year. However, Pakistani authorities claim that
            the gap will be smaller than projected five months ago, due to improved performance of the external sector.</p>

        <p>KARACHI:
        Donald Trump has trumped all odds, oddities, and omens to reclaim
        the White House in a dramatic political comeback. He survived two
        assassination attempts, two impeachments and a slew of criminal
        cases to pull off this spectacular feat, defying all the political
        pundits who had long written his political epitaph. Why Trump won
        and Kamala Harris lost is a different debate on which political
        commentators will continue to weigh in. Right now, the question
        worldwide is, what will be Trump 2.0’s foreign policy. A guessing
        game has already started because during his first term in the Oval
        Office he was erratic and unpredictable – if not whimsical, in his foreign policy dealings.</p>
